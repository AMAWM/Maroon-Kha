Guide to run the admin template:
-It is recommended to use the starter kit and add the components you need as you go instead of using the full version.
-It is recommended to use this template as the base of your project and build on it instead of adding it on top of your current project since this will cause many issues with integration and dependencies as per docs.
-You will need to install Yarn on your machine

Open the starter kit folder on VSCode, and run the following in the terminal:
 
 yarn install --frozen-lockfile
 
This ensures that there wonâ€™t be issues with dependencies.
Write this line to run the application
 
 yarn dev
 
Go to your local host to view your running application
